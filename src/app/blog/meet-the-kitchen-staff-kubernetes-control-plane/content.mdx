## The Kitchen Hierarchy

Every restaurant has a hierarchy. Kubernetes is no different. Here’s your kitchen management team (aka the **control plane**):

- **API Server** → Head Chef  
  Every order goes through the head chef. They approve, adjust, and delegate.  

- **etcd** → Recipe Book  
  The one true record. Ingredients, methods, customer preferences all stored here.  

- **Scheduler** → Kitchen Planner 
  Decides which station (worker node) cooks which dish (Pod). Keeps things balanced.  

- **Controller Manager** → Sous-Chef  
  Spots mistakes, fixes burnt dishes, and keeps everything running smoothly.  

- **CoreDNS** → Kitchen Intercom  
  When you yell “Table 5, Chicken Curry!”, it makes sure the right station hears you.

## Check Who’s Working

Run this to see the control plane components in action:

<CodeWindow title="Command">
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```
</CodeWindow>

Sample output:

Everything is alive and cooking.  

![kubectl get pods -n kube-system](https://website-2025-bucket.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog/meet-the-kitchen-staff-kubernetes-control-plane/kubectl-get-pods-1.png)

## Talking to the Head Chef

Want to see the full menu of what Kubernetes can serve? Ask the head chef directly:

<CodeWindow title="Command">
```bash
kubectl api-resources
```
</CodeWindow>

This command lists every “dish” Kubernetes knows how to make Pods, Services, Deployments, Jobs, and more. Think of it as reading the restaurant’s full menu.

![kubectl api-resources](https://website-2025-bucket.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog/meet-the-kitchen-staff-kubernetes-control-plane/kubectl-api-resources.png)

## Peeking at the Recipe Book

If you’re feeling brave, let’s peek at what’s inside the recipe book (`etcd`).  

<CodeWindow title="Command">
```bash
kubectl get pods -A -o yaml | head -20
```
</CodeWindow>

The output might look a bit like your ouma’s handwritten recipes messy at first, but once you know how to read it, it’s pure gold. 

![kubectl get pods -A -o yaml | head -20](https://website-2025-bucket.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog/meet-the-kitchen-staff-kubernetes-control-plane/kubectl-get-pods-2.png)

## Wrap-Up

Today you:  
- Met the **head chef, sous-chef, and planners** of Kubernetes  
- Checked who’s running your kitchen with `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`  
- Asked the head chef for the **menu of resources**  
- Peeped at the recipe book to see how Pods are defined

## Coming Tomorrow

Tomorrow, we leave the manager’s office and step onto the kitchen floor.  
You’ll deploy your **first dish (Pod)** and see how Kubernetes keeps it cooking.
